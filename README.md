# 🦖 Reinforcement Learning Chrome Dino Bot

A reinforcement learning agent that learns to play the Chrome Dinosaur game using Deep Q-Learning and vision-based input.

## 🎯 Goal

To train an AI agent that can play the classic Chrome Dino game by learning jump timing and obstacle avoidance through trial and error.

## 🧠 Approach

- Capture game screen using OpenCV
- Process state frames for learning
- Use DQN (Deep Q-Network) for action selection
- Learn from game-over rewards

## 🔧 Tools

- Python
- OpenCV
- PyAutoGUI / keyboard
- Gym-like custom environment
- TensorFlow / PyTorch

## 🚧 Work in Progress

`Code Coming Soon 🚧`

---

## 📌 To Be Added:

- 🎮 Live training screen
- 📊 Score tracking
- 🏁 Save/load model checkpoints
- 🧠 Optional: Try PPO or A3C instead of DQN
